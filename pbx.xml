  <title>PBX Setup</title>

  <para>A soft PBX (such as Asterisk or FreeSWITCH) provides features
  such as voicemail and call queues.  It is perfectly feasible to build
  an RTC environment without these features.  Many of the typical
  features in a soft PBX have a particular focus on voice communications,
  rather than other types of RTC such as IM or video.</para>

  <para>In a federated environment, it is recommended that a SIP proxy
  is used to handle all connectivity with external parties, including
  both incoming and outgoing sessions.  The SIP proxy servers have far
  less features and this inherently makes them easier to configure
  and secure.</para>

  <para>The soft PBX can be configured to register with the SIP proxy or
  routing entries can be created in both the SIP proxy and soft PBX to
  send calls back and forth between them as required.</para>
